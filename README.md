## What is Clarvynn?

**Clarvynn** is a source-level orchestration layer for OpenTelemetry.  
It transforms how developers and SREs manage observability by introducing **Telemetry as Code** — a declarative, language-agnostic approach to define what telemetry gets emitted, when, and why.

Built on top of OpenTelemetry.  
Optimized for clarity, not complexity.

---

## Why Clarvynn?

- Persistent exemplars with source-level correlation
- Declarative configuration via YAML
- Zero code instrumentation required
- Fully composable with the Prometheus + Tempo + Grafana ecosystem
- Git-friendly, CLI-native, infrastructure-aware

---

## Current Focus

- Python support (Flask, FastAPI, Django)
- Trace-metric correlation via exemplars
- Telemetry-as-Code configuration (TaC)
- CLI integration: `clarvynn run`

---

## Coming Soon

- Multi-language support (Go, Node.js, Java)
- Controlled exemplar creation filters
- Log correlation (opt-in)

---

## The Vision

OpenTelemetry defines the spec.  
Clarvynn defines the experience.

This isn’t about patching metrics or traces.  
It’s about making observability **predictable, programmable, and powerful** — starting at the source.

If you’ve ever said “this dashboard doesn’t explain anything,”  
Clarvynn is for you.
